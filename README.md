# Brand Kettle

## Overview

Welcome to the Brand Kettle App, my first solo project deployed on the Google Play Store. This Flutter app is designed to present our store designs and descriptions to potential clients. The key features of this app include:

- **Store Designs:** Users can browse through a collection of store designs created by our team. These designs are showcased with images and detailed descriptions.

- **Consultation Booking:** If a user finds a store design that they like, they have the option to book a consultation call for their own store. This feature is powered by Firebase's firestore database for efficient appointment scheduling.

- **Google Play Store Deployment:** This project represents my first experience in deploying an app to the Google Play Store, marking a significant milestone in my development journey.
